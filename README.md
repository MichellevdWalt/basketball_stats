# Basketball Team Stats Tool
In this project I wrote a program that reads from the "constants" data (`PLAYERS` and `TEAMS`) in `constants.py`. This data was translated into a new collection and the fields changed to something that makes more sense for Python to do its comparisons.

This is a command line program.
Start it with python3 app.py in the command line.
Follow the prompts to get data as read from the above mentioned collections.
